K			Number of clusters (Current example = 5, 10, 20, 30)
k			0 .. K
Pi[k]		Sum of percentages of all document falling under cluster k
				- Sum of all {Pi[k] | k -> 1..K} = 1
				- Initial value of Pi[k] = 1/K
W			Number of unique words in all documents (Current example = 12376)
w			0 .. W
Mu[w][k]	Weight of word w in cluster k
				- Sum of all {Mu[w][k] | w -> 1..W} = 1
				- Should be initialized with a random number between 0.25 and 0.75 
				 and then normalize to make them sum up to one.
D			Number of documents (Current example = 1500)
d			0 .. D
T[d][w]		Number of time word w is repeated in document d
E[d][k]		Expectation for document d to end up in cluster k
