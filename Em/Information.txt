K			Number of clusters
k			0 .. K
Pi[k]		Percentage of documents falling under cluster k
				- Sum of all {Pi[k] | k -> 1..K} = 1
				- Initial value of Pi[k] = 1/K
W			Number of unique words in all documents
w			0 .. W
Mu[w][i]	Probability of a document containing word w end up in cluster k
				- Sum of all {Mu[w][k] | k -> 1..k} = 1
D			Number of documents
d			0 .. D
T[d][w]		Number of time word w is repeated in document d
E[d][k]		Expectation for document d to end up in cluster k
